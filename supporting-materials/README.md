# Supporting Materials

Drop assets here for incorporation:

- Logo: provide final transparent PNG or SVG to replace `/public/logo.png`.
- Proof docs (IPFS CIDs & hashes): update `lib/placeholders.ts`.
- On-chain addresses: replace placeholders in `lib/placeholders.ts` (token, pool, LP locker, multisig, timelock).
- Legal copy: edit under `app/(marketing)/legal/*`.
- Press/media: add files to `/public/media/` and link them from `app/(marketing)/media/page.tsx`.

This directory is not used at runtime; it's for collaboration handoffs.
