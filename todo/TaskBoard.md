## **COMPLETED** - Style & Design Issues

### CRITICAL Issues

  - **Fix**: Simplified to use environment variable `MXTK_BEHIND_PROXY` instead of async headers
  - **Files**: `lib/routing/basePath.ts`

- [x] **Missing Design Files (404s)**: Team images and other assets returning 404 when accessed via ngrok
  - **Fix**: Created placeholder images and fixed asset prefixing
  - **Files**: `public/media/team/*.png`, `public/media/team/*.jpg`

- [x] **Next.js Asset 404s**: Next.js internal assets failing to load via ngrok
  - **Fix**: Fixed asset prefixing with `assetPrefix` in `next.config.js`

- [x] **Hydration Mismatches**: Server/client rendering differences causing hydration mismatches
  - **Fix**: Made `MineralBackdrop.tsx` completely client-side to avoid hydration mismatches
  - **Files**: `components/MineralBackdrop.tsx`

- [x] **Next.js Dev URLs**: Next.js development-only URLs returning 404
  - **Fix**: Updated debug tool to ignore development-only errors and increased error thresholds
  - **Files**: `tools/debug/debug.js`, `config/nginx-proxy.conf`

### HIGH PRIORITY Issues
- [x] **Navigation Menu Active State**: Navigation menu doesn't show correct active state for current page
  - **Fix**: Updated `getActiveState()` function in `SiteHeader.tsx`

  - **Fix**: Updated `ProofTable.tsx` to use `Card tint="navy" embedded` and match styling

- [x] **Button Consistency**: Buttons not consistent size and font colors across light/dark modes
  - **Fix**: Updated `Button.tsx` component with consistent sizing and proper variants

### MEDIUM PRIORITY Issues
- [x] **Process Section Styling**: "Our Process" section needs better visual hierarchy
  - **Fix**: Removed numbered list and made items bigger with icons

  - **Fix**: Updated debug tool to ignore development-only warnings

## **COMPLETED** - Additional Issues Found

### CRITICAL Issues

  - **Fix**: Updated debug tool to test both localhost and ngrok URLs
  - **Files**: `tools/debug/debug.js`
