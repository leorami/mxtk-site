# Managing Your Home Widgets

This guide explains how to add, remove, move, and configure widgets on your Home dashboard.

## Overview

- **What are widgets?** Widgets are modular cards (e.g., Recent Answers, Resources, What's Next) you can arrange on your Home.
- **Where is Home?** Go to the Home dashboard from the main navigation; your layout is saved to your profile.

## Add Widgets

- Open the Sherpa Guide (the “Sherpa” button in the header).
- In the Guide, look for sections labeled “Add to Home”.
- Click “Add to Home” on any widget to pin it to your dashboard.

## Remove Widgets

- Hover over a widget’s header to reveal actions.
- Click the remove “×” button. The widget disappears and your layout is saved.

## Move & Resize

- Drag the widget from its header to reposition.
- Use the corner handles to resize.
- Changes save automatically after a brief moment.

## Mobile Behavior

- On small screens, widgets stack in a single column.
- The system preserves your order and sizes when you return to desktop.

## Common Widgets

- Recent Answers: Shows your latest Sherpa Q&A.
- Resources: Quick links curated by the team.
- Glossary Spotlight: Rotating definitions for key terms.
- What’s Next: Suggested next steps for your journey.

## Troubleshooting

- If changes don’t stick, refresh the page and try again.
- If your Home is empty, open the Sherpa Guide and add widgets from suggested sections.
