    "text": "MXTK is backed by real-world mineral assets on a 1:1 basis. The process begins with third-party experts independently appraising and validating mineral assets. Once validated, these assets are converted into MXTK tokens, and the corresponding SKR (Safe Keeping Receipt) or deeds are secured. This ensures that each MXTK token represents an equivalent value of a real-world mineral asset.\n\nTo mint MXTK tokens, mineral owners need to provide one of the following:\n\n1. 43-101 REPORT: Detailed geological and technical assessments ensuring transparency and reliability.\n2. JORC REPORT: Provides guidelines for the public reporting of exploration results, mineral resources, and ore reserves.\n3. SKR (Safe Keeping Receipt): Proves ownership of mineral assets securely held.\n\nBy maintaining a direct correlation between token supply and physical asset backing, MXTK ensures that its value remains tied to the underlying mineral assets. 😊\n\nP.S. It's important to note that the validation process involves a multi-stage methodology, including initial AI screening, expert validator review, challenge period, and final arbitration. This rigorous process ensures the authenticity, ownership, and value of the mineral assets before they are tokenized. 🔒 👍",
