### Bot Q&A (Automated Attempt)
Source: `docs/reference/external/mineral-token.com/<timestamp>/bot/transcript.json`

- Result: Chat input not automatically detected by generic auditor. Manual pass or widget-specific selectors may be required to capture answers.
- Questions attempted include backing specifics, audits, participation, retail access, fees/liquidity/redemption, pricing/oracles, and risk/mitigations.

### Gaps/Follow-ups
- Confirm the $33B+ figure provenance, date, and supporting documentation.
- Identify audit reports, oracle sources, and redemption mechanics documentation.
- Determine eligibility and compliance flows (institutional vs retail), jurisdictional constraints.
- Capture and parse whitepaper highlights to reconcile with MXTK site content.

### Proposed Integration to mxtk-site
- Add a “At-a-Glance” stats widget reflecting: $33B+ committed, 1:1 ratio, global network (with provenance links).
- Expand “How It Works” with a 1:1 tokenization stepper and transparency references (logs, oracle data, OTC aggregates).
- Ensure light/dark theme support and accessibility for all new widgets; test with our auditor.
- Add AI-guided “journeys” language to hero/learn sections to align positioning.

### Compliance/Transparency Alignment
- Link to transparency features (IPFS proofs, oracle logs, OTC aggregates) and ensure data freshness.
- Add risk disclosures aligned with financial compliance requirements.
