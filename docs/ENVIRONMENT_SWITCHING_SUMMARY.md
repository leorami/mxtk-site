# 🎯 MXTK Environment Switching - Complete Implementation

## ✅ **Mission Accomplished!**

The MXTK smart-build.sh script now supports **seamless environment switching** with clear access information display.

---

## 🚀 **New Smart Build Commands**

### **Switch to Local Development**
```bash
./smart-dev-build.sh
```
- ✅ Uses `.env` for local access
- ✅ Rebuilds/restarts containers as needed
- ✅ Shows access URLs: `http://localhost:2000`
- ✅ API calls route to `/api/*`
- ✅ Navigation links have no `/mxtk` prefix

### **Switch to Proxy Development**
```bash
./setup-mxtk-site.sh share
```
- ✅ Proxy access at `https://<your-ngrok-domain>/mxtk`
- ✅ API calls route to `/mxtk/api/*`
- ✅ Navigation links have `/mxtk` prefix

### **Regular Commands**
```bash
./smart-dev-build.sh              # Build/rebuild smartly
./setup-mxtk-site.sh status       # Show environment status
```

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **1. Intelligent Environment Detection**
- ✅ Preserves current environment if no `local`/`proxy` flag
- ✅ Shows current mode in access information
- ✅ Provides switching instructions

### **2. Automatic Configuration Management**  
- ✅ Creates correct `.env.local` for each mode
- ✅ Forces rebuild when environment variables change
- ✅ Ensures containers pick up new configuration

### **3. Clear Access Information Display**
```
🌐 ACCESS INFORMATION
======================================
✅ Current Mode: LOCAL ACCESS
🔗 Primary URL: http://localhost:2000
⚠️  Proxy URL: https://ramileo.ngrok.app/mxtk (NOT AVAILABLE)

💡 To switch to proxy mode: ./scripts/smart-build.sh proxy
```

### **4. Engineer-Friendly Design**
- ✅ **No ambiguity** - always shows which mode is active
- ✅ **Easy switching** - single command to change modes
- ✅ **Helpful prompts** - shows exactly how to switch
- ✅ **Preserves workflow** - regular commands still work

---

## 📋 **How It Works**

1. **Environment Detection**: Script analyzes `.env.local` to determine current mode
2. **Smart Configuration**: Creates appropriate environment variables for chosen mode
3. **Container Management**: Forces rebuild when environment changes require it  
4. **Access Display**: Shows exactly where the app can be accessed
5. **Switch Prompts**: Provides exact commands to switch modes

---

## 🎉 **Benefits for Engineers**

- **🔄 Quick Switching**: Change between local and proxy with one command
- **🎯 Clear Status**: Always know which mode you're in
- **⚡ No Guesswork**: Script handles all configuration automatically
- **🛡️ Error Prevention**: Can't accidentally use wrong URLs
- **📱 Remote Collaboration**: Easy proxy mode for sharing with team

---

## 🧪 **Tested & Verified**

✅ **Local Mode**: `http://localhost:2000` + `/api/*` routes  
✅ **Proxy Mode**: `https://ramileo.ngrok.app/mxtk` + `/mxtk/api/*` routes  
✅ **Environment Switching**: Seamless transitions between modes  
✅ **Container Rebuilds**: Automatic when needed  
✅ **Access Information**: Clear, helpful display

**Your request has been fully implemented! Engineers can now easily switch between local and proxy development with clear visibility into which mode is active.** 🚀
