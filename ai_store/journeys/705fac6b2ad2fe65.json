      "body": "In plain words: Explain MXTK tokenomics simply\n\nSure! Let's break down MXTK tokenomics in simple terms: - **Tokenization**: MXTK is a token that represents real-world assets (RWAs), like minerals. This means each token is backed by a tangible asset, providing stability and value. - **Smart Contracts**: These are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They help automate processes like transactions and agreements, reducing the need for intermediaries. - **Security**: MXTK uses cryptographic security, which means it employs advanced encryption techniques to protect transactions and data. - **Efficiency**: The technology behind MXTK makes financial processes faster and more efficient by eliminating unnecessary steps and reducing fraud. - **Market Reach**: MXTK allows for global participation, meaning people from all over the world can invest and trade using this token. In plain words, MXTK is a digital token that represents real assets, uses smart technology to make finance more efficient and secure, and is accessible to a global audience.",

      "body": "MXTK transparency proofs are designed to build trust and ensure accountability. Here's how they work: - **Transparency Page**: This page will be posted to provide clear and accessible information about MXTK's operations and financials.\n- **Verified Contract**: The MXTK contract will be verified to ensure it operates as intended and is secure.\n- **Multisig with Timelock**: Admin control will be moved to a multisig (multiple signature) wallet with a timelock. This means decisions require multiple approvals and can't be executed immediately, adding security.\n- **Oracle Methodology**: The methodology for how price data is gathered and used will be published. This ensures that the data driving MXTK's value is reliable and transparent.\n- **Liquidity Pool (LP) Depth**: Initial liquidity of $5â€“10M will be locked on Uniswap v3 to provide stability and trust in the market. In plain words: MXTK uses clear rules and checks to show it's trustworthy and safe.",

MXTK tokenomics revolves around the concept of asset-backed cryptocurrency, which means each MXTK token is backed by real-world mineral assets. - **1:1 Asset-Backed Ratio**: Each MXTK token is directly tied to a verified mineral asset, ensuring full transparency and stability.\n- **Global Liquidity**: MXTK allows trading of mineral wealth on crypto exchanges worldwide, making it easier to access and invest in these assets.\n- **Pre-Extraction Value**: MXTK unlocks the value of mineral assets even before they are extracted, which is a new approach in the market. In plain words, MXTK tokens are like digital certificates that represent real minerals, making it easier to trade and invest in these resources globally.",
