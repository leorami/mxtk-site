      "body": "A Validator in the context of MXTK is a crucial participant in the MXTK Asset Validator Program. This program ensures that real-world assets are accurately verified before being tokenized and traded on the blockchain. Validators help build trust and compliance, which are essential for institutional adoption of tokenized assets. - **Role of Validators**: Validators provide a human-powered layer of verification for assets, ensuring their existence, ownership, and value.\n- **Types of Validators**: - **Generalist Validator**: Entry-level role for users who stake the minimum MXTK tokens. They review data and vote on asset validity. - **Certified Specialist**: Validators with proven professional credentials, verified securely.\n- **Game-Theoretic Model**: The program uses a sophisticated model to ensure a permissionless yet accountable system.\n- **Trust and Compliance**: Validators help create a self-regulating, auditable, and legally defensible process for bringing real-world assets on-chain. **In plain words**: Validators check and confirm that assets are real and valuable before they are turned into digital tokens, making the system trustworthy and reliable.",
