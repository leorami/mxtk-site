      "body": "MXTK's validator system is designed with sophisticated game theory:\n\n• **Staking Requirements**: Validators must stake MXTK tokens proportional to asset complexity\n• **Reputation System**: Multi-faceted, on-chain profiles that resist manipulation\n• **Dual Rewards**: Both integrity fees and minting bonuses incentivize honest participation\n• **Slashing Penalties**: Dynamic penalties that increase exponentially for coordinated attacks\n\nThis creates a self-regulating ecosystem where honest validation is the most profitable strategy.\n\nThese concepts form the foundation of MXTK's approach to institutional-grade tokenized assets.",
