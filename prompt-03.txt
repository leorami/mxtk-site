You are my senior Next.js engineer in the mxtk-site repo.

Goal: Add Basic Auth for Preview/Dev via middleware.ts, keep Production open, commit, and redeploy.

Steps:
1) Create a file at `middleware.ts` in the repo root with exactly this content:

<PASTE THE FILE CONTENT FROM THE CODE BLOCK I PROVIDED>

2) Create `.env.local` (not committed) if running locally with:
   BASIC_AUTH_ENABLED=1
   BASIC_USER=leo
   BASIC_PASS=choose-a-strong-pass

3) If using Vercel CLI, add Preview env vars:
   vercel env add BASIC_AUTH_ENABLED preview
   vercel env add BASIC_USER preview
   vercel env add BASIC_PASS preview
   # then paste values interactively

4) Build & test locally:
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000 â€” expect a browser Basic Auth prompt (enter the creds above)

5) Commit and push:
   git add middleware.ts
   git commit -m "feat: add Basic Auth middleware for preview/dev"
   git push

6) Redeploy on Vercel:
   vercel && vercel --prod
   # Or push to GitHub if Vercel is integrated for auto-deploys.

7) Report back with:
   - The Preview URL and confirmation that it prompts for Basic Auth
   - The Production URL and confirmation that it does NOT prompt
   - Any adjustments you had to make to the matcher exclusions
